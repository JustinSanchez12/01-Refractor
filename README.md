# Code Refractor

## Description
The objective of this project is to refractor the starter code to make the program more efficient and improve the functionality of the project.

This project is refactored by changing the starter code to semantic HTML elements, providing accessible alt atributes, viewing the heading attributes in sequential order, and providing a concise descriptive title.

## Source Code
The starter code was given to us during class for us to refractor for
this challenge. 

## Usage
![alt text](assets/images/image1.PNG)
